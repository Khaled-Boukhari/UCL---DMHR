Overall, this provides data scientists with the tools required for creating plots that are  visually pleasing, can convey insights from many differnt types of data and analyse datasets larger than is practical or realistically possible with other commonly used software.\n",

    "For this assignment, I will be importing Google flu trend data for Germany and Chile. As these datasets are stored in a `.txt` format, I will use the `pandas.read_table()` function. As `.txt` and `.csv` are both 'flat files', the data is parsed in a simmilar manner and can take the same arguments and parsing options. In both datasets, the headers are on the 8th row and the first column contains dates in a format, easily recognised and parsed by pandas. Instead of using the `pandas.to_datetime` function, less code is required to parse the date column as a datetime series during the reading in stage.\n",
